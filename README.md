# advanced-programming
As part of my Software Engineering Apprenticeship Degree, I was given two tasks to implement in an OOP language (C++).  The tasks will exhibit principles of C++ that have been learnt over the Advanced Programming module. This project was developed on MacOS using the Clang++ compiler.

## Task 1

Task 1 creates a simple game engine that consists of two classes representing entities within the game (GameComponent & DrawableGameComponent, which has an associated position â€“ x,y) and a controlling class (Game) that manages the entities (see Task1AssignmentBrief.txt).

### Dependencies
- **Operating System**: MacOS
- **Compiler**: Clang++ (supports C++17)
- **Development Tools**: A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Build Instructions
To build this program with an executable of gameEngine, use the following command:
```console
/usr/bin/clang++ -std=c++17 -arch arm64 main.cpp Game.cpp GameComponent.cpp DrawableGameComponent.cpp -o gameEngine
```

### Usage
To run the executable from the project directory, use the following command:
```console
task1/gameEngine 
```

### Example Output
Your output should look similar to:

```console

The actual results may differ as the second movement onwards is randomised. You will not get the same direction twice in a row.

## Task 2
